# ERC-721M and Syndicate API Backend Demo

This backend proxy server demo was built on ERC-721M and [Syndicate's APIs](https://docs.syndicate.io). It is used by a frontend to access Syndicate's APIs and update an ERC-721M NFT's metadata.

You can view and play with [the demo here](https://main--beamish-crepe-d28a4e.netlify.app). The frontend is hosted on Netlify, and the backend is hosted on Google Cloud. You can also see the repo for [the frontend demo app here](https://github.com/ianDAOs/demo-721m-frontend).
